# 🏗️ Daily System Design – In-Depth Analysis

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is a collection of **daily system design problems, solutions, and deep-dive analyses**.  
The goal is to build a strong understanding of **scalable architectures, distributed systems, and design trade-offs** by practicing consistently and documenting insights.

System design is a critical skill for software engineers, especially in interviews and real-world projects. This repo serves as a **daily journal and knowledge base** for exploring system design concepts step by step.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice **one system design problem per day**.
- Document solutions with **detailed explanations and diagrams**.
- Explore multiple approaches and trade-offs (scalability, availability, consistency, cost).
- Create a reference library for interview prep and real-world architecture decisions.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **Daily Designs:** Each day’s problem and solution stored in its respective folder (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`).
- **Notes:** Explanations of concepts, design patterns, and key takeaways.
- **Resources:** Links to helpful guides, books, and tutorials.
- **Diagrams:** Visual representations of architectures (draw.io, Mermaid, or PlantUML).

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from fellow engineers!  
Here’s how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repo** and create a new branch for your changes.
2. **Add designs:** Place your solution in the correct folder (e.g., `DayXX`).
3. **Explain your approach:** Include a markdown file with architecture diagrams and reasoning.
4. **Discuss trade-offs:** Highlight pros/cons of your design choices.
5. **Complexity analysis:** Add notes on scalability, latency, and cost considerations.
6. **Keep it clean:** Use consistent naming conventions and formatting.
7. **Pull Request:** Submit your PR with a short description of the problem and your solution.

## 🛣 Roadmap
- Add solutions for **daily system design challenges**.
- Expand notes with **patterns and strategies** (e.g., caching, sharding, load balancing).
- Curate a **topic-wise index** (databases, messaging queues, microservices, etc.).
- Add **visual diagrams** for each design problem.
